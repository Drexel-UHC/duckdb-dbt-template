**Column Description for gender:**

The gender column captures the gender identity of an individual. It provides information about the gender category to which a person identifies. In most cases, the gender column includes two possible values:

| Column Name | Possible Values |
|-------------|-----------------|
| gender      | Male            |
|             | Female          |

The gender column serves as an important demographic attribute, providing insights into the distribution and representation of different genders within a dataset or system. It is important to note that gender is a complex concept and may extend beyond the binary categories of Male and Female. In certain contexts, additional values such as Non-binary or Other may be included to account for a broader range of gender identities.

When working with the gender column, it is essential to respect and handle gender information with sensitivity and inclusivity, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and individual preferences. By appropriately capturing and analyzing gender data, organizations can gain a better understanding of gender diversity and tailor services and support accordingly.

## Column Description for ZCTA

The ZCTA (ZIP Code Tabulation Area) column contains numerical codes that represent unique geographic areas defined by the United States Postal Service (USPS). These codes approximate USPS ZIP Code delivery areas and are used for statistical analysis, research, and mapping purposes.

| Column Name | Description                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| ZCTA        | Numerical code representing a geographic area     |

- **ZCTA**: Numerical code representing a geographic area determined by the most frequently occurring ZIP Codes within the area.

The ZCTA column allows for convenient organization and categorization of data based on postal codes, providing insights into demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of different areas. It's important to note that ZCTA codes are subject to periodic updates by the USPS, so using the most current dataset is recommended for accurate analysis and interpretation.
